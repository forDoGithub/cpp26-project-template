// P2795R5: Erroneous behavior for uninitialized reads, [[indeterminate]] attribute

struct S {
    int a;
    bool b;
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int x; // Uninitialized
    S s_obj; // Uninitialized
    
    // Reading these might be UB if used to produce observable behavior.
    // P2795 aims to make reading itself not UB, but using the value in specific ways is.
    // Compilers often warn for this with -Wuninitialized.

    // Test 1: Read uninitialized, but don't use it in a way that affects output directly.
    // This is still risky. The proposal is about what the abstract machine does.
    // int y = x; // Read x
    // (void)y;   // Try to "use" y without affecting output.

    // Test 2: The [[indeterminate]] attribute
    // This attribute is intended to signal that the variable is intentionally left
    // uninitialized or that its current value is indeterminate.
    // The proposal suggests this could suppress warnings.
    [[indeterminate]] int indeterminate_val;
    [[indeterminate]] S indeterminate_s_obj;

    // Again, reading it directly is the test.
    // int read_indeterminate = indeterminate_val;
    // (void)read_indeterminate;

    // The core of P2795R5 is subtle: "A read of an indeterminate value that is not used to produce an
    // observable side effect is not undefined behavior".
    // This means just loading it into a register might be fine.
    // It's hard to demonstrate this without inspecting assembly or relying on warning suppression.

    // Let's see if [[indeterminate]] suppresses -Wuninitialized or -Wmaybe-uninitialized
    // We will try to use them in a way that would typically warn.
    int val_for_output = 100;

    if (argc > 1) { // Make sure this branch can be taken or not
        val_for_output = x; // Potential use of uninitialized 'x'
    } else {
        // val_for_output = indeterminate_val; // Potential use of indeterminate_val
    }
    // Using indeterminate_val directly in an if condition like `if (indeterminate_val > 0)`
    // would be using its value to affect control flow, which P2795 still implies could be problematic
    // if the value is "trap representation". The proposal is complex.

    // A simpler test: does [[indeterminate]] silence a direct uninitialized use warning?
    // int potentially_used_x = x; // Expect warning if -Wuninitialized is on
    // int potentially_used_i = indeterminate_val; // Expect NO warning if P2795 is supported for this attribute.

    // To check the warning, we need to compile with -Wuninitialized and see if
    // `indeterminate_val` is treated differently from `x`.
    // The snippet itself won't fail to compile due to this feature directly.
    // It's about runtime behavior definition and compiler analysis (warnings).

    std::cout << "P2795R5 (uninitialized reads, [[indeterminate]]) test." << std::endl;

    // For the purpose of this test, let's create a situation that *would* warn for 'x'
    // and see if 'indeterminate_val' behaves differently with the attribute.
    
    int uninit_check;
    // if (argc > 1) uninit_check = x; // This would typically warn if x is uninitialized
    // std::cout << "uninit_check with x: " << uninit_check << std::endl;

    // std::cout << "uninit_check with indet_check_val: " << uninit_check << std::endl;
    
    // The most direct test for [[indeterminate]] is if it silences a warning.
